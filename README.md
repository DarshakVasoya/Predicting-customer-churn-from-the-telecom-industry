# Predicting-customer-churn-from-the-telecom-industry
<p>We will explore classification using the K-Nearest Neighbors approach. We will use a customer churn dataset from the telecom industry, which includes customer data such as long-distance usage, data usage, monthly revenue, types of offerings, and other services purchased by customers. We are using the subset of customers who have phone accounts. Since the data includes a mix of numeric, categorical, and ordinal variables, we will load this data and do some preprocessing. Then we will use K-nearest neighbors to predict customer churn rates.</p>
